                <p class="pb-6">Hello guys, I know a lot of people think that if you have bad combinations in your chart
                    then no matter what you do, you'll never be able to
                    accomplish your goals in your life and end up in trouble. This thinking is not right as a majority
                    of people have some sort of bad planetary combinations and positions in their Birth Chart.
                    I have seen various people in my life who have performed splendidly in their life despite having
                    some bad combinations.</p>

                <p class="pb-6">I am pretty sure that if you're reading
                    this then your life will surely change. Have you heard about the butterfly effect ? In simple words,
                    even a small decision or action you take can have a really
                    deep or massive consequence(s) in the future and if you're reading this then maybe in the future it
                    will have a huge impact on your like. Who knows right ?</p>

                <p class="pb-6">To predict
                    the future is not an easy task and trust me no one can actually predict the future with 100 percent
                    accuracy. Our great sages had extraordinary knowledge and they were
                    very learned. In Kali Yuga much of the knowledge that we once had is lost. But still we have managed
                    to learn a little bit of astrology which I believe is enough to make
                    sure that we walk on the right path and reach our destination with ease.</p>

                <div class="border-l-4 border-gray-500 pl-4 mb-6 italic rounded">
                    “Astrology had an important role in the ancient world. You can’t understand many things unless you
                    know something about astrology—the plays of Shakespeare and so on.”
                </div>

                <p class="pb-6">So even if you have bad combinations, don't worry there must be some other good
                    combinations nullifying the
                    bad results. Doing what you love is the key to your success and also praying and making the gods
                    happy isn't a tough task.Even if you don't believe in god (I am certain you do), meditating is
                    always
                    a relaxing and stressbusting activity. Praying is nothing but a sort of meditation. </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl text-gray-800 font-semibold mb-4 mt-4">The Mantras!
                </h2>

                <p class="pb-6">They always create a positive aura around you and spread positive vibes. So don't worry
                    if you have bad planetary combinations, just work on your flaws and take
                    extra precaution during the Mahadsha aur Antardasha of the planet that is not well placed in your
                    horoscope and worship it's ruling deity. In most of the cases sheer willpower can fix all the bad
                    aspects of your kundli.
                    I wish you success and happiness in your life.</p>
